# Assignment 1 - Beginning Image Processing

## Grayscale Image Statistics:
### Image 1:
- Mean = 115.85591333333333 ≈ 115.86
- Standard Deviation = 38.51121956476868 ≈ 38.51

### Image 2:
- Mean = 29.955486666666665 ≈ 29.96
- Standard Deviation = 41.17698271158078 ≈ 41.18

## Why Are Some Channels More Visually Affected by Noise Than Others?
It appears that with both images, the green image is the most visually affected by noise, followed by the red channel, and the blue
channel is visually affected the least. This is because the green noise seems to stand out to me more. With the red and especially the blue noise, the noise tends to not stand out as much against the darker areas of the image. Additionally, with the blue variation of image 1, there seems to be less variation in the color values than in the red and green variations of the image. I believe this is also causing the blue noise to not visually affect the image as much.
