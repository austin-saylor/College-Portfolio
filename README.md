# Austin Saylor's College Portfolio

Welcome to my college portfolio! I'm a computer science graduate, and here you will find all of the work I did throughout my time in the program. This includes the major projects I worked on, as well as individual assignments.

## üíªProjectsüíª

**üî¥Connect 4 Gameüü°**

**Contributors**:
- Austin Saylor
- Kyle Remmenga
- Kian Highland

A basic connect-4 game which was built using python with object-oriented-design principles. Each "component" of the game, such as red/yellow chips, open spots to place them, and the board, is viewed as an object. This project uses the pygame library to provide a graphical interface to display the game on.

**Languages**: Python
**Key Skills**: Object-Oriented Design, Pygame

**üåéSolar System Simulatorü™ê**

This project simulates a basic model of the solar system. There are two versions of this project- one built with C++ and OpenGL, and another built with JavaScript and WebGL.

The OpenGL version contains 3 spheres in a matrix of space- the sun, earth, and moon. They each have their own textures which have been mapped to them from images. While not to scale, their spheres vary in size.

The WebGL version is more extensive- it contains the sun along with all 8 planets. They also have their own textures and vary in size. Additionally, all bodies spin at varying speeds and the planets orbit the sun at varying speeds and distances. Vertex and fragment shaders are used in this version to create lighting and atmospheric effects. When it comes to lighting, the inner planets receive more light while the outer planets receive less. As for the atmospheric effects, this can be seen on Earth and Mars, which have an atmosphere coating their main bodies.

**Languages**: C++, JavaScript, HTML
**Key Skills**: WebGL, OpenGL, Shaders

**‚òÄÔ∏èWeather AppüåßÔ∏è**

A simple weather app which runs in the terminal. This app was built using object-oriented design in python and uses textual to create a user interface that is cleaner and more sophisticated than a raw command-line interface. It allows users to search for a location based on a city name or zip code. State and/or country abbreviations can also be provided to further specify the location to be searched. The app utilizes API to provide real-time weather data for the chosen location, and provides the current temperature, weather condition, wind speed and direction, sunrise/sunset times, and more.

**Languages**: Python, CSS
**Key Skills**: Object-Oriented Design, API, Textual

------------------------------------------------
**Other Projects**:

- Network Scanner: A Python network scanner which uses ARP scanning, ICMP scanning, and port scanning to provide information about networks. This was tested on a virtual network that I built in GNS3.
- C++ vs Java Performance Comparison: An analysis of the pros and cons of using C++ and Java for development. This project also contains a graph that was programmed in both languages, for the purpose of comparing how fast each language can analyze the graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Starvation and Aging Program: A C++ program which illustrates the concept of starvation and aging in process management.
- Hangman Game: A simple command-line game of hangman programmed in C++.

## üê±Kattisüê±

I've done many kattis problems ranging in difficulty as assignments. Some of them I have completed using object-oriented design. All of these problems were completed using either C++ or Python.
