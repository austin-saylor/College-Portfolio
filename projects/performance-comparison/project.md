# CSCI 330 - Programming Languages Final Project - Java vs C++:
I did my final project on the Java Programming Language. For this project, I did some research on the features that make Java stand out from other languages, and I compared it to another popular programming language- C++. I also addressed the pros and cons to using Java for the development of projects. I presented my findings from this research to the class, and demonstrated a performance comparison between Java and C++ on a graph program.

## Presentation Notes:

- Foundation:
    - Java was created in 1995 by James Gosling, who worked at Sun Microsystems at the time.
    - Sun Microsystems was later acquired by Oracle in 2010.
    - It was based on C++.
    - The idea for the language was “Write once, run anywhere”.
- Usage:
    - While Java is an older language, it is still being widely used today for a variety of different purposes, such as:
        - 97% of Enterprise Applications Run Java
        - It’s used on 89% of Desktop Computers
        - 3 Billion Mobile Phones
        - 125 Million TV Devices
        - Game Development
        - Internet of Things (IoT)
        - AI and Machine Learning
        - 9 Million Developers across the Globe
- Characteristics:
    - Similar to C++ in syntax
    - An Object-Oriented Language
    - Platform-Independent
    - Multi-Threaded
        - This means that Java can handle multiple tasks at once, without using a large amount of memory.
- Pros of Java Development:
    - Object-Oriented:
        - Allows for more organized code.
        - Facilitates maintenance, and scalability.
        - Makes the code more understandable to humans.
    - Heightened Security:
        - With Java being an object-oriented language, it comes with features such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.
        - Encapsulation: Involves hiding the implementation details of one class from the others.
        - Inheritance: Enables the construction of new classes from existing ones.
        - Abstraction: Involves hiding the details of an object from the user.
        - In addition to all of this, Java has firm security policies.
        - All of this makes Java a very secure language, and make it an appealing choice to use for many applications.
    - Platform Independent:
        - Platform Independence means that developers can write code once, and can then run it on any platform through the use of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        - This is how the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” idea comes into play.
        - Java’s Platform Independence makes it a popular choice for:
            - Web Applications
            - Mobile Applications
            - Cloud Computing
            - Big Data Projects
            - All of these projects typically require cross-platform compatibility.
    - Architecture Neutral:
        - Java is an architecture-neutral language.
        - This means that Java code doesn’t execute differently on devices with different hardware.
        - Example:
            - In C programs, int data types occupy 2 bytes of memory in 32-bit architecture, and 4 bytes of memory in 64-bit architecture.
            - In Java programs, int data types occupy 4 bytes of memory in both 32 and 64-bit architectures.
        - As a result, Java Developers don’t have to worry about execution differences across different devices, and can instead focus more on building quality applications.
- Cons of Java Development:
    - Performance Issues:
        - Slower than other languages, such as C++
        - This is due to Java’s Virtual Machine and Memory Management
        - Garbage Collection
        - Caching Configurations
        - Thread Deadlocks may occur if they’re not properly managed.
    - Licensing Expenses:
        - In January of 2019, Oracle announced a charging policy for commercial licensing of Java 11 and higher.
    - GUI Development Complications:
        - There aren’t many advanced frameworks available in Java that allow for complex GUI development.
        - This makes Java less suitable for the development of desktop applications.
- Conclusion:
    - Java is an older language, but it is still widely used to this day.
    - It does have some notable drawbacks.
        - Namely, its performance issues.
    - However, It offers benefits that make it worth considering, such as its enhanced security and platform independence.
    - Java is still an ideal choice for various projects, such as:
        - Web/Mobile apps
        - Cloud computing
        - Big Data projects
